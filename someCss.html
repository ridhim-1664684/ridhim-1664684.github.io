<h1> What is Habitat for Humanity? </h1>
<br>
<p class="ex1">
    Habitat for Humanity partners with low income households to build, renovate, and repair simple simple and affordable homes.
    The Habitat homes are sold at no profit and are financed with affordable, no-interest loans.
    In partnership with these families and community groups, Habitat for Humanity develops quality homes and strengthens communities to help eliminate substandard housing.

    The Habitat construction site is a natural team-building environment for large and small organizations.
    There are more ways to volunteer than just construction. Help is always needed in their stores and their office!

    Starting May 3rd, come and join a community of Seattle-King County women to empower one another, make an impact, and change lives.
    The women of King County will fund projects, build homes, and revitalize neighborhoods working side-by-side with volunteers.
    Come to connect with like-minded people and make new friends!
    Most importantly, make a difference!
